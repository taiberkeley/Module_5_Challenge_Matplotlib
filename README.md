# Module 5 Challenge - Matplotlib
# Overview of the analysis: 
The Objective of this analysis is to help PyBer by creating a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type and also a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city types. Once that is created, I will analyse and summarize how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer
# Results: 
As per the Summay Table below and also Chart below, we can conclude that most drivers are allocated in the Rural areas and the Average $ Per Ride and Per Driver are lower in the Rural areas, among the 3 city types analyzed.
