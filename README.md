The Objective of this analysis is to create a create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type and to create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city types. Once that is created, I will analyse and summarize how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer
