# Module 5 Challenge - Matplotlib
# Overview of the analysis: 
The Objective of this analysis is to help PyBer by creating a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type and also a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city types. Once that is created, I will analyse and summarize how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer
# Results: 
As per the Summay Table and Chart below, we can conclude that most drivers are allocated in the Rural areas and the Average $ Per Ride and Per Driver are lower in the Rural areas, among the 3 city types analyzed. Total Fares is significantly higher in the Rural area compared with Urban and Suburban.

# Summary: 
Based on the results, one recomendation to balance the Average Fare ($) per Ride and Per Driver would be transfering more drivers from the Rural areas to the Urban and Suburban areas. This way, we would be spliting the rides among more drivers and potentially reducing the Average Fare per Driver($).
Other recommendation would be incentivizing and creating promotions for the users in the Urban and Suburban areas, this way reducing the Average Fare per Ride and Driver and attracting more drivers from the Rural areas to the other areas.
Finally, the last recommendation would be creating an alert so the drivers know when Average Fares are dropping on a city type so they can move to another cuty type. This happens for example im the last week of April. That would help drivers maximizing their profits going to the city type with more demand.
